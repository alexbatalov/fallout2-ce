# Fallout 2 Community Edition

## Installation

You must own the game to play. Purchase your copy on [GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/fallout_2) or [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/38410). Download latest release or build from source.

### Windows

Download and copy `fallout2-ce.exe` to your `Fallout2` folder. It serves as a drop-in replacement for `fallout2.exe`.

### Linux

- Use Windows installation as a base - it contains data assets needed to play. Copy `Fallout2` folder somewhere, for example `/home/john/Desktop/Fallout2`.

- Download and copy `fallout2-ce` to this folder.

- Install [SDL2](https://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php):

```console
$ sudo apt install libsdl2-2.0-0
```

- Run `./fallout2-ce`.

### macOS

> **NOTE**: macOS 10.11 (El Capitan) or higher is required. Runs natively on Intel-based Macs and Apple Silicon.

- Use Windows installation as a base - it contains data assets needed to play. Copy `Fallout2` folder somewhere, for example `/Applications/Fallout2`.

- Alternatively you can use Fallout 2 from Macplay/The Omni Group as a base - you need to extract game assets from the original bundle. Mount CD/DMG, right click `Fallout 2` -> `Show Package Contents`, navigate to `Contents/Resources`. Copy `GameData` folder somewhere, for example `/Applications/Fallout2`.

- Download and copy `fallout2-ce.app` to this folder.

- Run `fallout2-ce.app`.

### Android

> **NOTE**: Fallout 2 was designed with mouse in mind. There are many controls that require precise cursor positioning, which is not possible with fingers. When playing on Android you'll use fingers to move mouse cursor, not a character, or a map. Double tap to "click" left mouse button in the current cursor position, triple tap to "click" right mouse button. It might feel awkward at first, but it's super handy - you can play with just a thumb. This is not set in stone and might change in the future.

- Use Windows installation as a base - it contains data assets needed to play. Copy `Fallout2` folder to your device, for example to `Downloads`. You need `master.dat`, `critter.dat`, `patch000.dat`, and `data` folder.

- Download `fallout2-ce.apk` and copy it to your device. Open it with file explorer, follow instructions (install from unknown source).

- When you run the game for the first time it will immediately present file picker. Select the folder from the first step. Wait until this data is copied. A loading dialog will appear, just wait for about 30 seconds. The game will start automatically.

### iOS

> **NOTE**: See Android note on controls.

- Download `fallout2-ce.ipa`. Use sideloading applications ([AltStore](https://altstore.io/) or [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/)) to install it to your device. Alternatively you can always build from source with your own signing certificate.

- Run the game once. You'll see error message saying "Couldn't find/load text fonts". This step is needed for iOS to expose the game via File Sharing feature.

- Use Finder (macOS Catalina and later) or iTunes (Windows and macOS Mojave or earlier) to copy `master.dat`, `critter.dat`, `patch000.dat`, and `data` folder to "Fallout 2" app ([how-to](https://support.apple.com/HT210598)).

## Contributing

Integrating Sfall goodies is the top priority. Quality of life updates are OK too. Please no large scale refactorings at this time as we need to reconcile changes from Reference Edition, which will make this process slow and error-prone. In any case open up an issue with your suggestion or to notify other people that something is being worked on.

### Intergrating Sfall

There are literally hundreds if not thousands of fixes and features in sfall. I guess not all of them are needed in Community Edition, but for the sake of compatibility with big mods out there, let's integrate them all.
