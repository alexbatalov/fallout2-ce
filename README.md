# Fallout 2 Community Edition

## Installation

You must own the game to play. Purchase your copy on [GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/fallout_2) or [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/38410). Download latest release or build from source.

### Windows

Download and copy `fallout2-ce.exe` to your `Fallout2` folder. It serves as a drop-in replacement for `fallout2.exe`.

### Linux

- Use Windows installation as a base - it contains data assets needed to play. Copy `Fallout2` folder somewhere, for example `/home/john/Desktop/Fallout2`.

- Download and copy `fallout2-ce` to this folder.

- Install [SDL2](https://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php):

```console
$ sudo apt install libsdl2-2.0-0
```

- Run `./fallout2-ce`.

### macOS

> **NOTE**: macOS 10.11 (El Capitan) or higher is required. Runs natively on Intel-based Macs and Apple Silicon.

- Use Windows installation as a base - it contains data assets needed to play. Copy `Fallout2` folder somewhere, for example `/Applications/Fallout2`.

- Alternatively you can use Fallout 2 from Macplay/The Omni Group as a base - you need to extract game assets from the original bundle. Mount CD/DMG, right click `Fallout 2` -> `Show Package Contents`, navigate to `Contents/Resources`. Copy `GameData` folder somewhere, for example `/Applications/Fallout2`.

- Download and copy `fallout2-ce.app` to this folder.

- Run `fallout2-ce.app`.

### Android

> **NOTE**: Fallout 2 was designed with mouse in mind. There are many controls that require precise cursor positioning, which is not possible with fingers. When playing on Android you'll use fingers to move mouse cursor, not a character, or a map. Double tap to "click" left mouse button in the current cursor position, triple tap to "click" right mouse button. It might feel awkward at first, but it's super handy - you can play with just a thumb. This is not set in stone and might change in the future.

- Download `fallout2-ce.apk` and copy it to your device. Open it with file explorer, follow instructions (install from unknown source).

- Run the game once, it will say `Couldn't find/load text fonts` and create a folder for data assets.

- Open file explorer, navigate to `Android/data/com.alexbatalov.fallout2ce/files`, delete junk folders inside (they will be named as game files, just delete them).

- Copy `master.dat`, `critter.dat`, `patch000.dat` and `data` folder from your Windows/macOS installation to the folder above.

- Run the game again.

## Contributing

Integrating Sfall goodies is the top priority. Quality of life updates are OK too. Please no large scale refactorings at this time as we need to reconcile changes from Reference Edition, which will make this process slow and error-prone. In any case open up an issue with your suggestion or to notify other people that something is being worked on.

### Intergrating Sfall

There are literally hundreds if not thousands of fixes and features in sfall. I guess not all of them are needed in Community Edition, but for the sake of compatibility with big mods out there, let's integrate them all.
